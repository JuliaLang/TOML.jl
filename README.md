*Note:*  In Julia 1.6+, this is a standard library and does not need to be explicitly installed.

*Note:*  A different TOML package was previously hosted in this package's URL. If you have the older package (UUID `191fdcea...`) installed in your environment from `https://github.com/JuliaLang/TOML.jl.git`, `update` and other `Pkg` operations may fail. To switch to this package, remove and re-add `TOML`. The old TOML package (which only supports TOML 0.4.0) may be found in `https://github.com/JuliaAttic/TOML.jl`.
